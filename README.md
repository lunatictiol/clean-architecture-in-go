Project Name: clean-architecture-practice-go
Main Language: Go
Description: A Go project for practicing clean architecture, including a server, configuration, and internal services.

Features:

* Clean architecture pattern implementation
* Go language usage
* SQL database integration
* RESTful API implementation

Getting Started:
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Install Go on your computer if you haven't already.
2. Clone the repository using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/clean-architecture-practice-go.git`.
3. Change into the cloned repository directory using `cd clean-architecture-practice-go`.
4. Run the server using `go run cmd/main.go`.
5. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to access the RESTful API.

Folder Structure:
The project is organized into the following folders:

* `cmd`: Contains the main Go file `main.go`.
* `configs`: Holds the configuration files for the server, including the `Server.go` file.
* `internal`: Includes the internal services and repositories, such as `userDelivery/userHandler.go`, `userDomain/interface.go`, `userRepository/repository.go`, and `userUsecase/userUsecase.go`.
* `postgres`: Contains the PostgreSQL database integration files, including the `db.go` file.

Key Files:
The following are some of the key files in the project:

* `main.go`: The main Go file that runs the server.
* `Server.go`: Contains the implementation of the server.
* `configs/Server.go`: Holds the configuration for the server.
* `userDelivery/userHandler.go`: Implements the RESTful API for user delivery.
* `userDomain/interface.go`: Defines the interface for the user domain.
* `userRepository/repository.go`: Implements the repository for user data.
* `userUsecase/userUsecase.go`: Implements the use case for user data.
* `db.go`: Contains the PostgreSQL database integration code.
